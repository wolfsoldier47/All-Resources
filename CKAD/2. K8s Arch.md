ETCD: distributed Key-value pair. The state of the kubernetes cluster is stored in the Etcd

Control Manager: Controls the complete Control plane of Kubernetes. Node controller, application controller, endpoint controller and the token controller.

Scheduler: decides what resource needs to be scheduled on which worker node.

kube ApiServer:
- Only interaction point to interact with K8s
- Accept Rest Commands to interact with cluster Resources.
kube scheduler:
 - Regulate tasks on slave nodes
Controller:
 - Manage kubernetes jobs
 - Manage all Probes and Auto Jobs

<h3> Worker Nodes </h3>
Multiple worker nodes can be attached 1..N
Worker Nodes are the actual resources. 
it has three main components:
- Kubelet
	- K8's agent execute on worker Node
	- Get the Pod config from API server, Ensure Pods and container State.
- Container Runtime Pods
	- Group of single/multiple containers with shared storage/network
	- container in single pod can communicate over local host
- KubeProxy
	- kubeproxy is used to manage the service in k8s
	- kubeproxy ensure, application is accessible over the service to outer parties.
