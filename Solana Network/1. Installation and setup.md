- make sure rust is installed 
	- rustup --version
	- cargo --version
	- or you can install from here
	```
	curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
	```
- install solana: 
```
sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://release.solana.com/v1.18.15/install)"
```



- Creating a new wallet
```
solana-keygen new   #if want to recreate a new wallet just add --force
```

- checking balance on the network
```
solana balance --url devnet  # devnet is a simulated verion of the mainnetwork designed for testing and development purpose
```

- retrieve public key
```
solana-keygen pubkey
```

- go to explorer.solana.com, switch to devnet and search your publickey
- Air dropping ourselves some SOL
```
solana airdrop 2 <publickey> --url devnet  #this will airdrop 2 SOL into our test wallet
```


- Tokens are only created using spl programs and when they go on blockchain they are given a unique address. and that address will allow us to retrieve info about the token.
- creating token using spl library and save the address
```
spl-token create-token --url devnet
```


- Accounts are like files which ares stored on blockchain and we can put data in them in solana wallet. in order to collect a particular type of token we need to have an account in our wallet which is specific to that token. a wallet can have multiple account and each account is used to transact one type of token.
```
spl-token create-account <token address from create-token> --url devnet #copy the token account
```


- checking the number of token we have 
```
spl-token balance <token-address> --url devnet
```


- creating a new token is called minting and this is how it can be achieved
```
spl-token mint  <token-address> 1000 --url devnet
```


- circulating supply: total number of tokens that are being used by solana users
```
spl-token supply <token-address> --url devnet
```

- minting alot of token can be a problem and if we can mint alot of tokens and lets say we have investors in the project they might not like it because it might reduce the percent share in the project.
- limiting minting authority
```
spl-token authorize <token-address> mint --disable --url devnet

```


- burning token: Removing token which i own out of circulation and can never be used but you cant remove token which are owned by other people.
```
spl-token burn <token-account> 100 --url devnet #this will remove 100 tokens. remmber to use token account address NOT token address
```
