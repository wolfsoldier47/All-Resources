Tracing function can be enabled or disabled from the file in /sys/kernel/tracing/tracing_on.




<h2> ftrace enablement on kernel</h2>
by default its enabled hence to check if the tracer is enabled see the following:
- cat /boot/config-\`uanme -r\` |  grep CONFIG_FTRACE
-  cat /boot/config-\`uanme -r\` |  grep CONFIG_FUNCTION_TRACE
-  cat /boot/config-\`uanme -r\` |  grep CONFIG_FUNCTION_GRAPH_TRACE
- cat /boot/config-\`uanme -r\` |  grep CONFIG_STACK_TRACER

Check tracing directory
 - ls /sys/kernel/tracing  # new kernels
 - ls /sys/kernel/debug/tracing # new kernels

Mount the tracing  directory before starting
 - mount -t tracefs nodev /sys/kernel/tracing
	 -  if make an entry in /etc/fstab
		 - tracefs    /sys/kernel/tracing    tracefs defaults     0    0

<h2>ftrace importants </h2>

- all manipulation is done with file operations echo/cat in tracefs
- smart lockless ring buffer implementation
- buffer stores all tracing information and is exposed as a file in tracefs
- available_tracers
	- nop : No Action
	- function: trace kernel functions entry
	- function_graph: trace kernel functions entry and exit thus allowing to build a call graph
	- blk: block tracer/blktrace
	- mmiotrace: Trace interactions between drivers and hardware
- to see **all tracers** see the file available_tracers in /tracing folder 
- to see **CURRENT** tracer see file current_tracer
- to **enable** on system level# by default its enabled
	- echo 1 > /sys/kernel/tracing/tracing_on
- to **disable** on system level
	- echo 0 > /sys/kernel/tracing/tracing_on
- to **test** a particular function
	- echo 1 > tracing_on; run_test; echo  0 > tracing_on
	- ftrace has a ring buffer size which can be looked up in the file called **buffer_size_kb**



<h2> Enabling Tracers</h2>
- echo "name of tracer function"  > current_tracer
- to see all the available functions cat available_tracers
- and then check the file cat tracer 
- Reading the tracer file

Kernel Function can only be executed either:
			- System call
			-  User Process
			-  An interrupt
<h3> Function tracer </h3>
- Function tracer records return address,entry and exit of function, execution time and cpu on which it is running
- . All functions inside the log starts with '{' and end with '}'. 
- ';' is used when function do not call any other functions.
```

<h3> Filter Available Function Tracers</h3>

- to see all the filters available check the file **available_filter_functions**
- to enable or disable functions in the log output ftrace prints, you can make changes in the following files
	- set_ftrace_filter          # only trace these functions
	- set_ftrace_notrace    # do not trace these functions
- you can use wildcards when setting filters for example 
```
	echo vfs_* > set_ftrace_filter
```

- if functions with same name are enabled then both will be enabled

<h2> Few Important files </h2>
<h3>trace vs trace_pipe file</h3>
- trace file will stop immediately if the file is being read by the user.
- trace_pipe will keep consuming and will continue filtering even if its being read by the user. 

<h3>Filtering function graph tracing using set_graph_function file</h3>
- set_graph_function is useful to find out what calls made by a kernel function with function_graph set as current_tracer. its similar to set_ftrace_filter
- example:
```
 echo > set_ftrace_filter
 echo "function_graph" > current_tracer
 echo "vfs_read" > set_graph_function
 cat trace   #to see the 
### disabling
set_graph_notrace  # disable function graph tracing when the function is hit until it exits the function
```
