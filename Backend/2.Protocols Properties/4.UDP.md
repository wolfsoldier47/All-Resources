- layer 4 
- ability to processes in a host using ports
- simple protocol
- prior communication isnt required
- stateless protocol
- 8 bytes header diagram
- Datagram slides into an IP packet as data
- Port are 16 bit (0 to 65535)

<h3> Use cases </h3>
- video streaming
- VPN
- DNS
- WebRTC

Anything that has a mapping it can be a problem for example: ARP poisoning or DNS poisoning 


<h3> Multiplexing and demultiplexing </h3>
- IP targets host only
- Hosts run many apps each with different requirements
- Ports identify the app or process
- Sender multiplexes all its app into UDP
- Receiver demultiplexes UDP datagram to each app

<h4>UDP pros </h4>
- SImple protocol
- header size is small so datagrams are small
- uses less bandwidth
- stateless
- Consumes less memory
- Low latency - no handshake, order,re transmission, or guaranteed delivery


#### UDP Cons
- No acknowledgement
- No guarantee
- Connection-less - anyone can send data without prior knowledge
- No flow control
- No congestion control
- No ordered packets
- Security - can easily be spoofed
