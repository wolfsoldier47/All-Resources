when designing a protocol what matters is, whether your use case is solved or not ?
what is a protocol ?
- A system that allows two parties to communicate
- A protocl is designed with a set of properties
- Depending on the purpose of the protocol
- TCP,UDP,HTTP,gRPC,FTP
- TCP is hitting its limit new protocol (Homa)


Protocol Properties 
- Data Format
	- Text based(plain text, JSON,XML)
	- Binary(protobuf,RESP,h2,h3)
- Transfer mode
	- Message Based(UDP,HTTP)
	- Stream(TCP,WebRTC)
- Addressing system (where it is going where you coming from eg: DNS,MAC, IP)
- Directionality
	- Bidirectional(TCP)
	- Unidirectional(HTTP)
	- Full/Half Duplex(wifi is half duplex, no two device can send at the same time)
- State
	- stateful(TCP,gRPC,apache thrift)
	- Stateless(UDP,HTTP)
- Routing
	- Proxies, Gateways
- Flow and congestion control
	- TCP (Flow and congestion)
	- UDP (No control)
- Error Management
	- Error code
	- Retrues and timeouts
