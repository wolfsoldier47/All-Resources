Why do we need a communication model ?
- Agnostic applications
	- App doesnâ€™t need to to know network medium 
	- Otherwise we need an App for WIFI, ethernet vs LTE vs fiber
- Network Equipment Management
	- Without a standard model, upgrading network equipments becomes difficult
	- Decoupled Innovation
	- Innovations can be done in each layer separately without affecting the rest  of the models

What is an OSI model ?
7 layers each descirbe a specific networking component
- layer 7 - Application = HTTP/FTP/gRPC
- Layer 6 - Presentation - Encoding, Serialization (json object being encoded )
- Layer 5 - Session - Connection establishment, TLS (Linkerd proxy)
- Layer 4 - Transport UDP/TCP
- Layer 3 - Network - IP
- Layer 2 - Data Link - Frames, Mac Address Ethernet
- Layer 1 - Physical - Electric signals, Fiber or radio waves

<h2>OSI layer as example (sender)</h2>

- Example sending a POST request to an HTTPS webpage
- Layer 7 - Application
	- POST request with JSON data to HTTPS server
- Layer 6 - Presentation
	- Serialize JSON to flat byte strings
- Layer 5 - Session
	- Request to establish TCP connection/TLS
- Layer 4 - Transport
	- Sends SYN request target port 443
- Layer 3 - Network
	- SYN is placed an IP packets and adds the source/dest IP's
- Layer 2 - Data link
	- Each packet goes into a single frame and adds the source/dest MAC addresses
- Layer 1 - Physcial
	- Each frame becomes string of bits which converted into either a radio signal(wifi), electric signal(ethernet) or light(fiber)


<h2>OSI layer as example (receiver)</h2>
- Receiver computer recives the POST request the other way around
- Layer 1 - Physical
	- Radio, electric or light is received and converted into digital bits
- Layer 2 - Data link
	- The bits from layer 1 is assembled into frames
- Layer 3 - Network
	- The frames from layer 2 are assembled into IP packet
- Layer 4 - Transport
	- The IP packets from layer 3 are assembled into TCP segments
	- Deals with congestion control/flow control/retransmission in case of TCP
	- if segment is SYN we dont need to go further into more layers as we are still processing the connection request
- Layer 5 - Session
	- The connection session is established or identified
	- We only arrive at this layer when necessary(three way handshake is done)
- Layer 6 - Presentation
	- Deserialize flat byte strings back to JSON for the app to consume
- Layer 7 - Application
	- Application understand the JSON POST request and your express json or apache request receive event is triggered

An example of how client is communicating with the server across the network where in between router and switches are sitting which process the frames and the packet

Now lets consider what will happen if its going through proxies,firewall,CDN to the backend server

Howerver between layer 5-6-7 as just one layer can be considered because they are basically doing almost the same thing and people argue about it all the time.
for this reason TCP/IP model was introduced

TCP/IP model
- Applicaion (layer 5,6,7)
- Transport (layer 4)
- Internet (Layer 3)
- Data Link (Layer 2)
- Physical layer is not officially covered in the model
