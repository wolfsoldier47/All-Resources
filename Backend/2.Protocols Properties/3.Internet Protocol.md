- IP Address
	- Layer 3
	- Can be set automatically or statically
	- Network and Host portion
	- 4 bytes in IPv4 - 32bits
- Network VS Host
	- 192.168.254.0/24 where the first 24 bits are network and the rest 8 are for host
	- also called subnet
- Subnet Mask
	- 192.168.0.0/24 is also called a subnet
	- the subnet has a mask 255.255.255.0

- Default gateway
	- when you want to communicate outside of your network then you need to talk with gateway

A case: if DB is sitting on a different network and application is trying to communicate with it however due to gateway being slow the request send to DB is taking time/ this is where you can check if this is a network problem


<h2> IP packet </h2>
- IP packet has headers and data sections
- IP packet header is 20 bytes but can go to 60 bytes if options are enabled
- data section can go up to 65536 bytes 
![[Pasted image 20240319103634.png]]

- Version: IP version example Ipv4 or IpV6
- IHL: Internet header length. This contains the size of the IP packet header. or how many more options you need.
- DSCP: Differentiated Service Code Point. originally known as TOS(type of service). This field specifies Differentiated services. Real-time data streaming makes use of it. Example VoIP uses it 
- ECN: Explicit congestion notification. This field allow end to end notification of network congestion without dropping packets. Its an optional feature. This bit is set by the router. When router is filled with packets and the buffer is full thats where congestion takes place and the packet is are droppepd by router, but the client will notice that the time's up and the client  will immediately assume the packet is dropped. at this point router will set the ECN bit on the packet right before the buffer is about to be filled and eventually every client will know that there is a congestion
- Total length: Entire packet size in bytes. data + header where it can go up to 2^16
- Identification: primarily used for uniquely identifying the group of fragments of a single IP datagram.Some experimental work has suggested using the ID field for other purposes, such as for adding packet-tracing information to help trace datagrams with spoofed source addresses, but any such use is prohibited now.
- Flags: This tell if i have to fragment the packet or not.A three-bit field follows and is used to control or identify fragments. They are
	- bit 0 : Reserved; must be zero
	- bit 1 : Dont fragment (DF)
	- bit 2 : More Fragments (MF)
	- If the DF flag is set, and fragmentation is required to route the packet, then the packet is dropped. This can be used when sending packets to a host that does not have resources to perform reassembly of fragments. It can also be used for MTU Discovery Path, either automatically by the host IP software, or manually using diagnostic tools such as ping or traceroute.
	- For unfragmented packets, the MF flag is cleared. For fragmented packets, all fragments except the last have the MF flag set. The last fragment has a non-zero Fragment Offset field, differentiating it from an unfragmented packet
- Fragment Offset: very hard to write. depends on MTU.if IP packet doesnt fit then you can either tell the client that the ip packet is larger than MTU send error via ICMP or fragment it. now host need to see to assemble it. This is a security issue as people can fake fragmentation  
- Header Checksum
- Time to Live: its for the routing. to avoid routing the packet forever. ICMP packet is send once TTL is zero.. 
- Protocol. The protocol of what type of content is inside the data.
- Source Address: The source from where the packet is coming
- Destination Address: The destination to  where the packet is going to.
- Options

<h2> ICMP </h2>
- Internet Control Message Protocol lives in Layer 3
- Designed for informational messages
- Uses IP directly
- Ping and traceroute use it
- Doesnt require listeners or ports to be opened
