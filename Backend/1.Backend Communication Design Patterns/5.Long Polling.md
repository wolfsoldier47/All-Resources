Uses by Kafka to avoid a lot of traffic. It uses a trick called talk to me only when its ready and it doesn't send a response until the job is ready.
- A request takes long time to process
	- Upload a youtube video
- The backend want to sends notification
	- A user just logged in
- Short Polling is a good but too much

So what is long polling ?
- Client sends a request
- Server responds immediately with a handle
- Server continues to process the request
- Client uses that handle to check for status
- Server DOES not reply until it has the response
- So we got a handle, we can disconnect and we are sending less requests(less chatty)
- Some variation has timeouts too
