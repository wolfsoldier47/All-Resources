the classic request and response pattern.

- Client sends a request 
- Server parses the Request ( the backend needs to understand the request, parsing is expensive)
- Server Processes the Request ( example: knowing a git request is one thing and then fetching and doing the job is another)
- Server sends a Response and consume ( the boundary of response;)
- Client parses the Response and consume

-  Where request and response is being used ?
	- Web, HTTP, DNS, SSH 
	- RPC (remote procedure call)
	- SQL and Database Protocols
	- APIs (REST/SOAP(Simple object access protocol)/GraphQL)
<h2>1.1 Anatomy of a Request / Response</h2>
- A request structure is defined by both client and server
- Request has a boundary
- Defined by a protocol and message format
- all of this is same for the response

Sending an image example :
  - sending a whole file in one go 
  - sending chunks of file 

Does the request response work everywhere ?
  few examples here where it cant work.
  - Notification service
  - Chatting application
  - Very Long requests ( better to use Async)
  - what if client disconnects in long requests ?

- the time t0 to t2 is the time taken for the request to arrive to the server and the server understands the protocol in that time.
- The cost of the process to reassmble,rewrite the packet is from t2-t30
- the time from t30-t32 is the sending of packet to the client back aka transfer
