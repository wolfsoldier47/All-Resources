What is a short polling ?
- Client sends a request
- Server responds immediately with a handle
- Server continues to process the request
- Client uses that handle to check for status
- Multiple "short" request response as polls

When request/response isn't ideal ?
- A request takes long time to process
	- upload a youtube video
- The backend want to sends notification
	- A user just logged in

Short Polling Pros and c ons
- Pros
	- Simple
	- good for long running requests
	- Client can disconnect {The backend can save the job in the disk and once the polling is done again the result is given back}
- Cons
	- Too chatty multiple requests coming in and server is receiving requests constantly and imagine multiple clients making polls
	- Congesting Network Bandwidth
	- Wasted Backend resources { even if backend receives a check poll request so that check itself needs resources}
