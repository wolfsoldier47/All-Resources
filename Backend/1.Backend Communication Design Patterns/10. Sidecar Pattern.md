The Sidecar pattern is **a design pattern that focuses on extending the functionality of a primary service**
Every protocol has its own library lets say HTTP,TLS,gRPC, or HTTP/2 on which the application relies

- Changing the library is hard
	- Once you use the library your app is entrenched
	- App & library "should" be same language
	- Changing the library require retesting
	- Breaking changes backward compatibility
	- Adding features to the library is hard
	- Microservices suffer
- What if we delegate communication ?
	- Proxy communicate instead
	- Proxy has the rich library
	- Client has thin library (e.g. h1)
	- Meet sidecar pattern
	- Each client must have a  sidecar proxy

The http and TLS are taken care by the proxy and if you want to upgrade then need to upgrade the proxy itself thats all

- Other sidecar examples
	- Service Mesh Proxies
		- Linkerd,Istio,Envoy
	- Sidecar proxy container
	- has to be Layer 7 proxy
- Pros and Cons of sidecar proxy
	- Pros:
		- Language agnostic(polyglot)
		- Protocol upgrade
		- Security
		- Tracing and Monitoring gets easier
		- Service Discovery (discover services via centralized DNS system)
		- Caching
	- Cons
		- Complexity increases
		- Latency
