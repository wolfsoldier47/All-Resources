- All these protocols below uses it.
	- http/2,QUIC,connection pool, MPTCP(multi path TCP)
- Multiplexing is you receive 3 request and on the server and merge into one path  
- Demultiplexing is the vice versa of multiplexing where you receive one singal path consisting of 2 or more request and demultiplexing to different paths

- Multiplexing examples in HTTP/2
![[Pasted image 20240309195145.png]]
- in HTTP/1.1 the limitation of 6 channels was implemented where if 2 or more request are send each request will open a new connection.
- However in HTTP/2 to overcome this limitation multiplexing and demultiplexing was introduced where all request was multiplexed into one channel or connection

- limitation is the high backend resources 

Demultiplexing HTTP/1.1 on the backend

Connection Pooling in DB
![[Pasted image 20240309200039.png]]
- A hot pool of connections are opened to the DB
- Backend is receiving a single path where its demultiplexing
- if 3 different request are going through one channel then database will execute the query and lets say if the second query is executed and finishes first while the 3 and the first one are still executing the response of the second query will be sent to the backend immediately and the backend doesn't know if the response of query 2 is from the 2nd request. however to overcome this problem there are certain ways such as tagging or adding an ID so the backend knows which SQL query was it
