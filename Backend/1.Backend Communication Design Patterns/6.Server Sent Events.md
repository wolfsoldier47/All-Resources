Pure HTTP One Request, a very very long response.

Limitation of Request/Response
- Vanilla Request/Response isn't ideal notification backend
- Client wants real time notification from backend
	- A user just logged in
	- A message is just received
- Push works but restrictive
- Server Sent Events work with Request/response

What is Server Sent events ?
- A response has start and end
- Client sends a request
- Server sends logical events as part of response
- Server never writes the end of the response
- It is still a request but an unending resposnse
- Client parses the streams data looking for events
