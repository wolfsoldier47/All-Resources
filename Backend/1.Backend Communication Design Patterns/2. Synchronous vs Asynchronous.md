<h2> Synchronous I/O </h2>

- Caller sends a request and blocks every other things
	- context switching: giving generous execution time
- Caller cannot execute any code meanwhile
- Receiver responds, caller unblocks
- Caller and Receiver are in "sync" 
- Example of Synchronous 
```
//program starts
// program uses CPU to execute stuff
doWork();
//Program reads from disk
//Program can't do anything until file loads
readFile("readlargefile.dat");
//program resumes
doWork2();
```


<h2> Asynchronous I/O </h2>
- caller sends a request
- caller can work until it gets a response
- caller either:
	- checks if the response is ready (epoll in linux)
	- Receiver calls back when its done(io_uring in linux)
	- Spins up a new thread that blocks
- Caller and reciever are NOT in sync

Example of OS asynchronous call in NodeJS
- program spins up a  secondary thread
- secondary thread reads from disk,  OS blocks it
- Main program still running and executing code
- Thread finish reading and call back main thread
- Example of Asynchronous
```
// Program starts
//program uses CPU to execute stuff
doWork();
//program requests read from disk
//program asks to callback when done
// Program moves on to doWork2
readFile("largefile.dat",onReadFinished(theFile));
//file is probbaly not read yet
// prgoram happy doing stuff
doWOrk2();
//someone just called onReadFinished
//processing it.
------->onReadFinished(theFile)
```

Synchronous vs Asynchronous in Request Response

- Synchronicity is a client property 
- Most modern client libraries are asynchronous
- E.g. Clients send an HTTP request and do work
- Email is Asynchronous communication

<h2> Asynchronous workload is everywhere </h2>
- Asynchronous Programming (promises/future)
- Asynchronous backend Processing
	- A client sending a request and its long running the backend is running the process while the client has moved in and waiting for the backend to response this whole process might be asynchronous to the user but the process is still synchronous because the backend knows that that someone is still waiting for me to respond.So the handler is putting the request in the queue making clients unblocked while the backend giving a job ID. ( basically a trick)
- Asynchronous commits in postgres
	- wal(write ahead logging) where  the changes are written and the page where all the columns are rows are present and the data is written to both. ACID properties. unblock the caller who commits and return success or failure if the wal has been flushed to desk
- Asynchronous IO in linux (epoll, io_uring)
- Asynchronous replication of DB to other READ commits
- Asynchronous OS fsync (fs cache). when you write a file it doesnt go to disk immediately instead it goest to fs cache  and then try to write pages. OS waits for loads of writes in the memory and then flush them to the disk. (writing on the same block of disk can actually damage the disk causing disk failure)
