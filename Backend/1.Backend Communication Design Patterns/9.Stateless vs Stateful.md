Its a style of storing state within the application. This can be taken to system,backend, a function or a protocol


<h2> stateful vs stateless backend </h2>
- stateful
	- stores state about clients in its memroy
	- depends on the information being there
- Stateless
	- Client is responsible to "transfer the state" with every request
	- May store but can safely lose it
- Example of stateless backends
	- can still store data somewhere else
	- can you restart the backend during idle time while the client workflow continues to work ?
- what makes a backend stateless ?
	- backend remain stateless but the system is stateful
	- storing of state somewhere else
	- can u restart the backend during idle time and the client workflow continue to work ?

Notice the session isnt stored in the database.
but where does the things break ?
![[Pasted image 20240310011634.png]]
The session ID was only stored in the memory and not in Database hence no login.

How to solve this problem ?
make it stateful by storing sessions to the database. however the system is statful now.


<h2> stateless vs stateful protocols </h2>
- The Protocols can be dsigned to store state
- TCP is stateful (connection,windows size, connection file descriptor, congestion control is managed )
- UDP is stateless
	- DNS send queryID in UDP to identify queries
	- QUIC sends connectionID to identify connection (everytime)
- You can build a stateless protocol on top of a stateful one and vice versa
- HTTP on top of TCP
- if TCP breaks, HTTP blindly create another one
- QUIC is build on top of UDP which is actually stateful

what is complete stateless system ?
- stateless system are rare
- state is carried with every request
- a backend service that relies completely on the input
	- To check if input is a prime number or not
- JWT (stateless)
