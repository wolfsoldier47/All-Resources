# Introduction to AI


AI enables us to build amazing software that can improve health care, enable people to overcome physical disadvantages, empower smart infrastructure, create incredible entertainment experiences, and even save the planet!


# Understand machine learning


Machine Learning is the foundation for most AI solutions. Since the 1950's, researchers, often known as _data scientists_, have worked on different approaches to AI. Most modern applications of AI have their origins in machine learning, a branch of AI that combines computer science and mathematics.

Let's start by looking at a real-world example of how machine learning can be used to solve a difficult problem.

Sustainable farming techniques are essential to maximize food production while protecting a fragile environment. _The Yield_, an agricultural technology company based in Australia, uses sensors, data, and machine learning to help farmers make informed decisions related to weather, soil, and plant conditions.

## How machine learning works

So how do machines learn?

The answer is, from data. In today's world, we create huge volumes of data as we go about our everyday lives. From the text messages, emails, and social media posts we send to the photographs and videos we take on our phones, we generate massive amounts of information. More data still is created by millions of sensors in our homes, cars, cities, public transport infrastructure, and factories.

Data scientists can use all of that data to train machine learning models that can make predictions and inferences based on the relationships they find in the data.

Machine learning models try to capture the relationship between data. For example, suppose an environmental conservation organization wants volunteers to identify and catalog different species of wildflower using a phone app. The following animation shows how machine learning can be used to enable this scenario.

![An animation of the steps of machine learning.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/get-started-ai-fundamentals/media/machine-learn.gif)

1. A team of botanists and scientists collect data on wildflower samples.
2. The team labels the samples with the correct species.
3. The labeled data is processed using an algorithm that finds relationships between the features of the samples and the labeled species.
4. The results of the algorithm are encapsulated in a model.
5. When new samples are found by volunteers, the model can identify the correct species label.

Approaches to AI have advanced to complete tasks of much greater complexity. These complex models form the basis of AI capabilities.

# Understand Responsible AI


At Microsoft, AI software development is guided by a set of six principles, designed to ensure that AI applications provide amazing solutions to difficult problems without any unintended negative consequences.

## Fairness

AI systems should treat all people fairly. For example, suppose you create a machine learning model to support a loan approval application for a bank. The model should predict whether the loan should be approved or denied without bias. This bias could be based on gender, ethnicity, or other factors that result in an unfair advantage or disadvantage to specific groups of applicants.

Azure Machine Learning includes the capability to interpret models and quantify the extent to which each feature of the data influences the model's prediction. This capability helps data scientists and developers identify and mitigate bias in the model.

Another example is Microsoft's implementation of [Responsible AI with the Face service](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/responsible-ai-investments-and-safeguards-for-facial-recognition/), which retires facial recognition capabilities that can be used to try to infer emotional states and identity attributes. These capabilities, if misused, can subject people to stereotyping, discrimination or unfair denial of services.

For more details about considerations for fairness, watch the following video.

## Reliability and safety

AI systems should perform reliably and safely. For example, consider an AI-based software system for an autonomous vehicle; or a machine learning model that diagnoses patient symptoms and recommends prescriptions. Unreliability in these kinds of systems can result in substantial risk to human life.

AI-based software application development must be subjected to rigorous testing and deployment management processes to ensure that they work as expected before release.

For more information about considerations for reliability and safety, watch the following video.

## Privacy and security

AI systems should be secure and respect privacy. The machine learning models on which AI systems are based rely on large volumes of data, which may contain personal details that must be kept private. Even after the models are trained and the system is in production, privacy and security need to be considered. As the system uses new data to make predictions or take action, both the data and decisions made from the data may be subject to privacy or security concerns.

For more details about considerations for privacy and security, watch the following video.

## Inclusiveness

AI systems should empower everyone and engage people. AI should bring benefits to all parts of society, regardless of physical ability, gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, or other factors.

For more details about considerations for inclusiveness, watch the following video.

## Transparency

AI systems should be understandable. Users should be made fully aware of the purpose of the system, how it works, and what limitations may be expected.

For more details about considerations for transparency, watch the following video.

## Accountability

People should be accountable for AI systems. Designers and developers of AI-based solutions should work within a framework of governance and organizational principles that ensure the solution meets ethical and legal standards that are clearly defined.

For more details about considerations for accountability, watch the following video.

The principles of responsible AI can help you understand some of the challenges facing developers as they try to create ethical AI solutions.
