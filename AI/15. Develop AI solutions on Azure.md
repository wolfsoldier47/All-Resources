# Define artificial intelligence


Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly prevalent in the software applications we use every day; including digital assistants in our homes and cellphones, automotive technology in the vehicles that take us to work, and smart productivity applications that help us do our jobs when we get there.

So what actually is artificial intelligence?

There are many definitions; some technical, some philosophical; but in general terms, we tend to think of AI as software that exhibits one or more human-like capabilities, as shown in the following table:

|Capability|Description|
|---|---|
|![An image of an eye](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/prepare-to-develop-ai-solutions-azure/media/visual-perception.png)|**Visual perception** - The ability to use _computer vision_ capabilities to accept, interpret, and process input from images, video streams, and live cameras.|
|![An image of a text document](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/prepare-to-develop-ai-solutions-azure/media/text.png)|**Text analysis and conversation** - The ability to use _natural language processing (NLP)_ to not only "read", but also generate realistic responses and extract semantic meaning from text.|
|![An image of speech bubbles](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/prepare-to-develop-ai-solutions-azure/media/speech.png)|**Speech** - The ability to recognize speech as input and synthesize spoken output. The combination of speech capabilities together with the ability to apply NLP analysis of text enables a form of human-compute interaction that's become known as _conversational AI_, in which users can interact with AI agents (usually referred to as _bots_) in much the same way they would with another human.|
|![An image of a human head with a cog](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/prepare-to-develop-ai-solutions-azure/media/decision-support.png)|**Decision making** - The ability to use past experience and learned correlations to assess situations and take appropriate actions. For example, recognizing anomalies in sensor readings and taking automated action to prevent failure or system damage.|

These kinds of capabilities are increasingly within the reach of everyday software applications, helping make them more intuitive and useful in a wide variety of scenarios that previously existed only in the realms of science fiction.


# Understand AI-related terms


There are several related terms that people use when talking about artificial intelligence, so it's useful to have clear definitions for each.

![Data science underpins machine learning, which underpins artificial intelligence](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/prepare-to-develop-ai-solutions-azure/media/terminology.png)

## Data science

Data science is a discipline that focuses on the processing and analysis of data; applying statistical techniques to uncover and visualize relationships and patterns in the data, and defining experimental _models_ that help explore those patterns.

For example, a data scientist might gather samples of data about the population of an endangered species in a geographical area, and combine it with data about levels of industrialization and economic demographics in the same area. The data can then be analyzed, using statistical techniques to extrapolate from the samples to understand trends and relationships between human activities and wildlife, and test hypotheses using models that show the likely impact of human activity on the wildlife population. By doing so, the data scientists may help determine optimal policies that balance the need for economic wellbeing for the human population with the need for conservation of the endangered wildlife.

## Machine learning

Machine learning is a subset of data science that deals with the training and validation of _predictive_ models. Typically, a data scientist prepares the data and then uses it to train a model based on an algorithm that exploits the relationships between the _features_ in the data to predict values for unknown _labels_.

For example, a data scientist might use the data they have collected to train a model that predicts the annual growth or decline in population of a species based on factors such as the number of nesting sites observed, the area of land designated as protected, the human population in the local area, the daily volume of traffic on local roads, and so on. This predictive model can then be used as a tool to evaluate plans for housing, infrastructure, and industrial development in the local area and assess their likely impact on the local wildlife.

## Artificial intelligence

Artificial intelligence usually (but not always) builds on machine learning to create software that emulates one or more characteristics of human intelligence.

For example, balancing the need for wildlife conservation against economic development requires accurate monitoring of the population of the endangered species being protected. It may not be feasible to rely on human experts who can positively identify the animal in question, or to monitor a large area over a sufficient period of time to get an accurate count. Indeed, the presence of human observers may deter animals and prevent their detection. In this case, a predictive model could be trained to analyze image data taken by motion-activated cameras in remote locations, and predict whether a photograph contains a sighting of the animal. The model could then be used in a software application that responds to automated identification of animals to track animal sightings across a large geographical area, identifying areas with dense animal populations that may be candidates for protected status.


# Understand considerations for AI Engineers


![A software engineer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/prepare-to-develop-ai-solutions-azure/media/ai-engineer.png)

Increasingly, software solutions include AI features; so software engineers need to know how to integrate AI capabilities into their applications and services.

The advances made in machine learning, together with the increased availability of large volumes of data and powerful compute on which to process it and train predictive models, has led to the availability of prepackaged software services that encapsulate AI capabilities. Software engineers can take advantage of these services to create applications and agents that use the underlying AI functionality, using them as building blocks to create intelligent solutions.

This means that software engineers can apply their existing skills in programming, testing, working with source control systems, and packaging applications for deployment, without having to become data scientists or machine learning experts.

However, to fully capitalize on the opportunities of AI, software engineers do require at least a conceptual understanding of core AI and machine learning principles.

## Model training and inferencing

Many AI systems rely on predictive models that must be _trained_ using sample data. The training process analyzes the data and determines relationships between the _features_ in the data (the data values that will generally be present in new observations) and the _label_ (the value that the model is being trained to predict).

After the model has been trained, you can submit new data that includes known _feature_ values and have the model predict the most likely _label_. Using the model to make predictions is referred to as _inferencing_.

Many of the services and frameworks that software engineers can use to build AI-enabled solutions require a development process that involves training a model from existing data before it can be used to inference new values in an application.

## Probability and confidence scores

A well-trained machine learning model can be accurate, but no predictive model is infallible. The predictions made by machine learning models are based on _probability_, and while software engineers don't require a deep mathematical understanding of probability theory, it's important to understand that predictions reflect statistical likelihood, not absolute truth. In most cases, predictions have an associated _confidence score_ that reflects the probability on which the prediction is being made. Software developers should make use of confidence score values to evaluate predictions and apply appropriate thresholds to optimize application reliability and mitigate the risk of predictions that may be made based on marginal probabilities.

## Responsible AI and ethics

It's important for software engineers to consider the impact of their software on users, and society in general; including ethical considerations about its use. When the application is imbued with artificial intelligence, these considerations are particularly important due to the nature of how AI systems work and inform decisions; often based on probabilistic models, which are in turn dependent on the data with which they were trained.

The human-like nature of AI solutions is a significant benefit in making applications user-friendly, but it can also lead users to place a great deal of trust in the application's ability to make correct decisions. The potential for harm to individuals or groups through incorrect predictions or misuse of AI capabilities is a major concern, and software engineers building AI-enabled solutions should apply due consideration to mitigate risks and ensure fairness, reliability, and adequate protection from harm or discrimination.



# Understand considerations for responsible AI


The previous unit introduced the need for considerations for responsible and ethical development of AI-enabled software. In this unit, we'll discuss some core principles for responsible AI that have been adopted at Microsoft.

## Fairness

![An image of scales](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/prepare-to-develop-ai-solutions-azure/media/fairness.png)

AI systems should treat all people fairly. For example, suppose you create a machine learning model to support a loan approval application for a bank. The model should make predictions of whether or not the loan should be approved without incorporating any bias based on gender, ethnicity, or other factors that might result in an unfair advantage or disadvantage to specific groups of applicants.

Fairness of machine learned systems is a highly active area of ongoing research, and some software solutions exist for evaluating, quantifying, and mitigating unfairness in machine learned models. However, tooling alone isn't sufficient to ensure fairness. Consider fairness from the beginning of the application development process; carefully reviewing training data to ensure it's representative of all potentially affected subjects, and evaluating predictive performance for subsections of your user population throughout the development lifecycle.

## Reliability and safety

![An image of a shield](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/prepare-to-develop-ai-solutions-azure/media/reliability-safety.png)

AI systems should perform reliably and safely. For example, consider an AI-based software system for an autonomous vehicle; or a machine learning model that diagnoses patient symptoms and recommends prescriptions. Unreliability in these kinds of system can result in substantial risk to human life.

As with any software, AI-based software application development must be subjected to rigorous testing and deployment management processes to ensure that they work as expected before release. Additionally, software engineers need to take into account the probabilistic nature of machine learning models, and apply appropriate thresholds when evaluating confidence scores for predictions.

## Privacy and security

![An image of a padlock](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/prepare-to-develop-ai-solutions-azure/media/privacy-security.png)

AI systems should be secure and respect privacy. The machine learning models on which AI systems are based rely on large volumes of data, which may contain personal details that must be kept private. Even after models are trained and the system is in production, they use new data to make predictions or take action that may be subject to privacy or security concerns; so appropriate safeguards to protect data and customer content must be implemented.

## Inclusiveness

![An image of a group of people](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/prepare-to-develop-ai-solutions-azure/media/inclusiveness.png)

AI systems should empower everyone and engage people. AI should bring benefits to all parts of society, regardless of physical ability, gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, or other factors.

One way to optimize for inclusiveness is to ensure that the design, development, and testing of your application includes input from as diverse a group of people as possible.

## Transparency

![An image of an eye](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/prepare-to-develop-ai-solutions-azure/media/transparency.png)

AI systems should be understandable. Users should be made fully aware of the purpose of the system, how it works, and what limitations may be expected.

For example, when an AI system is based on a machine learning model, you should generally make users aware of factors that may affect the accuracy of its predictions, such as the number of cases used to train the model, or the specific features that have the most influence over its predictions. You should also share information about the confidence score for predictions.

When an AI application relies on personal data, such as a facial recognition system that takes images of people to recognize them; you should make it clear to the user how their data is used and retained, and who has access to it.

## Accountability

![An image of a handshake](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/prepare-to-develop-ai-solutions-azure/media/accountability.png)

People should be accountable for AI systems. Although many AI systems seem to operate autonomously, ultimately it's the responsibility of the developers who trained and validated the models they use, and defined the logic that bases decisions on model predictions to ensure that the overall system meets responsibility requirements. To help meet this goal, designers and developers of AI-based solution should work within a framework of governance and organizational principles that ensure the solution meets ethical and legal standards that are clearly defined.

# Understand capabilities of Azure Cognitive Search


Searching for information is a common requirement in many applications, from dedicated _search engine_ web sites to mobile apps that can find context-appropriate information based on where you are and what you want to accomplish.

![Diagram of a search solution using AI services to extract insights from data and create an index for search.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/prepare-to-develop-ai-solutions-azure/media/cognitive-search.png)

**Azure AI Search** is an Applied AI Service that enables you to ingest and index data from various sources, and search the index to find, filter, and sort information extracted from the source data.

In addition to basic text-based indexing, Azure AI Search enables you to define an _enrichment pipeline_ that uses AI skills to enhance the index with insights derived from the source data - for example, by using computer vision and natural language processing capabilities to generate descriptions of images, extract text from scanned documents, and determine key phrases in large documents that encapsulate their key points.

Not only does this AI enrichment produce a more useful search experience, the insights extracted by your enrichment pipeline can be persisted in a _knowledge store_ for further analysis or integration into a data pipeline for a business intelligence solution.
