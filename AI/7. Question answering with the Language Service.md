_Conversational AI_ describes solutions that enable a dialog between an AI agent and a human. Generically, conversational AI agents are known as bots. People can engage with bots through channels such as web chat interfaces, email, social media platforms, and more.


**Question answering** supports natural language AI workloads that require an automated conversational element. Typically, question answering is used to build bot applications that respond to customer queries. Question answering capabilities can respond immediately, answer concerns accurately, and interact with users in a natural multi-turned way. Bots can be implemented on a range of platforms, such as a web site or a social media platform.
