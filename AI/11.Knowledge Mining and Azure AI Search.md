# What is Azure AI Search?


Azure AI Search provides the infrastructure and tools to create search solutions that extract data from various structured, semi-structured, and non-structured documents.

Azure AI Search results contain only your data, which can include text inferred or extracted from images, or new entities and key phrases detection through text analytics. It's a Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution. Microsoft manages the infrastructure and availability, allowing your organization to benefit without the need to purchase or manage dedicated hardware resources.


## Azure AI Search features

Azure AI Search exists to complement existing technologies and provides a programmable search engine built on Apache Lucene, an open-source software library. It's a highly available platform offering a 99.9% uptime SLA available for cloud and on-premises assets.

Azure AI Search comes with the following features:

- **Data from any source**: accepts data from any source provided in JSON format, with auto crawling support for selected data sources in Azure.
- **Full text search and analysis**: offers full text search capabilities supporting both simple query and full Lucene query syntax.
- **AI powered search**: has Azure AI capabilities built in for image and text analysis from raw content.
- **Multi-lingual** offers linguistic analysis for 56 languages to intelligently handle phonetic matching or language-specific linguistics. Natural language processors available in Azure AI Search are also used by Bing and Office.
- **Geo-enabled**: supports geo-search filtering based on proximity to a physical location.
- **Configurable user experience**: has several features to improve the user experience including autocomplete, autosuggest, pagination, and hit highlighting.

A typical Azure AI Search solution starts with a data source that contains the data artifacts you want to search. This could be a hierarchy of folders and files in Azure Storage, or text in a database such as Azure SQL Database or Azure Cosmos DB. The data format that Azure AI Search supports is JSON. Regardless of where your data originates, if you can provide it as a JSON document, the search engine can index it.


# Use a skillset to define an enrichment pipeline

AI enrichment refers to embedded image and natural language processing in a pipeline that extracts text and information from content that can't otherwise be indexed for full text search.

Built-in skills fall into these categories:

**Natural language processing skills**: with these skills, unstructured text is mapped as searchable and filterable fields in an index.

Some examples include:

- Key Phrase Extraction: uses a pre-trained model to detect important phrases based on term placement, linguistic rules, proximity to other terms, and how unusual the term is within the source data.
    
- Text Translation Skill: uses a pre-trained model to translate the input text into various languages for normalization or localization use cases.
    

**Image processing skills**: creates text representations of image content, making it searchable using the query capabilities of Azure AI Search.

Some examples include:

- Image Analysis Skill: uses an image detection algorithm to identify the content of an image and generate a text description.
    
- Optical Character Recognition Skill: allows you to extract printed or handwritten text from images, such as photos of street signs and products, as well as from documents—invoices, bills, financial reports, articles, and more.


# Understand indexes


An Azure AI Search index can be thought of as a container of searchable documents. Conceptually you can think of an index as a table and each row in the table represents a document. Tables have columns, and the columns can be thought of as equivalent to the fields in a document. Columns have data types, just as the fields do on the documents.

### Index schema

In Azure AI Search, an index is a persistent collection of JSON documents and other content used to enable search functionality. The documents within an index can be thought of as rows in a table, each document is a single unit of searchable data in the index.

### Index attributes

Azure AI Search needs to know how you would like to search and display the fields in the documents. You specify that by assigning attributes, or behaviors, to these fields. For each field in the document, the index stores its name, the data type, and supported behaviors for the field such as, is the field searchable, can the field be sorted?

# Use an indexer to build an index


In order to index the documents in Azure Storage, they need to be exported from their original file type to JSON. In order to export data in any format to JSON, and load it into an index, we use an indexer.

To create search documents, you can either generate JSON documents with application code or you can use Azure's indexer to export incoming documents into JSON.

### Use the pull method to load data with an indexer

Azure AI Search's indexer is a crawler that extracts searchable text and metadata from an external Azure data source and populates a search index using field-to-field mappings between source data and your index

### Data import monitoring and verification

The search services overview page has a dashboard that lets you quickly see the health of the search service. On the dashboard, you can see how many documents are in the search service, how many indexes have been used, and how much storage is in use.

### Making changes to an index

You have to drop and recreate indexes if you need to make changes to field definitions. Adding new fields is supported, with all existing documents having null values. You'll find it faster using a code-based approach to iterate your designs, as working in the portal requires the index to be deleted, recreated, and the schema details to be manually filled out.

# Persist enriched data in a knowledge store

A knowledge store is persistent storage of enriched content. The purpose of a knowledge store is to store the data generated from AI enrichment in a container.

![[Pasted image 20240415111312.png]]

Recall that skillsets move a document through a sequence of enrichments that invoke transformations, such as recognizing entities or translating text. The outcome can be a search index, or projections in a knowledge store. The two outputs, search index and knowledge store, are mutually exclusive products of the same pipeline; derived from the same inputs, but resulting in output that is structured, stored, and used in different applications.

A knowledge store can contain one or more of three types of projection of the extracted data:

- Table projections are used to structure the extracted data in a relational schema for querying and visualization
- Object projections are JSON documents that represent each data entity
- File projections are used to store extracted images in JPG format

# Create an index in the Azure portal

Completed 100 XP

- 3 minutes

Before using an indexer to create an index, you'll first need to make your data available in a supported data source. Supported data sources include:

- Cosmos DB (SQL API)
- Azure SQL (database, managed instance, and SQL Server on an Azure VM)
- Azure Storage (Blob Storage, Table Storage, ADLS Gen2)

Once your data is in an Azure data source, you can begin using Azure AI Search. Contained within the Azure AI Search service in Azure portal is the Import data wizard, which automates processes in the Azure portal to create various objects needed for the search engine. You can see it in action when creating any of the following objects using the Azure portal:

- **Data Source**: Persists connection information to source data, including credentials. A data source object is used exclusively with indexers.
- **Index**: Physical data structure used for full text search and other queries.
- **Indexer**: A configuration object specifying a data source, target index, an optional AI skillset, optional schedule, and optional configuration settings for error handling and base-64 encoding.
- **Skillset**: A complete set of instructions for manipulating, transforming, and shaping content, including analyzing and extracting information from image files. Except for very simple and limited structures, it includes a reference to an Azure AI services resource that provides enrichment.
- **Knowledge store**: Stores output from an AI enrichment pipeline in tables and blobs in Azure Storage for independent analysis or downstream processing.

# Query data in an Azure AI Search index

Azure AI Search supports two types of syntax: simple and full Lucene. Simple syntax covers all of the common query scenarios, while full Lucene is useful for advanced scenarios.

### Simple query requests

A query request is a list or words (search terms) and query operators (simple or full) of what you would like to see returned in a result set. Let's look what components make up a search query Consider this simple search example:

```
coffee (-"busy" + "wifi")
```

This query is trying to find content about coffee, excluding busy and including wifi.

Breaking the query into components, it's made up of search terms (`coffee`), plus two verbatim phrases, `"busy"` and `"wifi"`, and operators (`-`, `+`, and `( )`). The search terms can be matched in the search index in any order or location in the content. The two phrases will only match with exactly what is specified, so `wi-fi` would not be a match. Finally, a query can contain a number of operators. In this example, the `-` operator tells the search engine that these phrases should _NOT_ be in the results. The parenthesis group terms together, and set their precedence


## Azure resources needed

The solution you’ll create for Fourth Coffee requires the following resources in your Azure subscription:

- An **Azure AI Search** resource, which will manage indexing and querying.
- An **Azure AI services** resource, which provides AI services for skills that your search solution can use to enrich the data in the data source with AI-generated insights.
    
    > **Note** Your Azure AI Search and Azure AI services resources must be in the same location!
    
- A **Storage account** with blob containers, which will store raw documents and other collections of tables, objects, or files.


# Knowledge check

## Check your knowledge

1.

Which data format is accepted by Azure AI Search when you're pushing data to the index?

CSV.

SQL.

JSON.

Correct. Azure AI Search can index JSON documents. JSON is also used to define index schemas, indexers, and data source objects.

2.

Which explanation best describes an indexer and an index?

An indexer converts documents into JSON and forwards them to a search engine for indexing.

Correct. An indexer serializes a source document into JSON before passing it to a search engine for indexing. An indexer automates several steps of data ingestion, reducing the amount of code you need to write.

An indexer can be used instead of an index if the files are already in the proper format.

An indexer is only used for AI enrichment and skillset execution.

3.

If you set up a search index without including a skillset, which would you still be able to query?

Sentiment.

Text content.

Correct. Azure AI Search is used for full text search over indexes containing alphanumeric content.
