# Introduction


Containers enable you to host Azure AI services either on-premises or in Azure. For example, if your application uses sensitive data in an on-premises SQL Server to call an Azure AI services service, you can deploy Azure AI services in containers on the same network. Now your data can stay on your local network and not be passed to the cloud. Deploying Azure AI services in a container on-premises will also decrease the latency between the service and your local data, which can improve performance.

In this module, you'll learn how to:

- Create containers for reuse.
- Deploy to a container and secure a container.
- Consume Azure AI services from a container.

# Use Azure AI services containers


There are container images for Azure AI services in the Microsoft Container Registry that you can use to deploy a containerized service that encapsulates an individual Azure AI services service API.

To deploy and use an Azure AI services container, the following three activities must occur:

1. The container image for the specific Azure AI services API you want to use is downloaded and deployed to a container host, such as a local Docker server, an Azure Container Instance (ACI), or Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).
2. Client applications submit data to the endpoint provided by the containerized service, and retrieve results just as they would from an Azure AI services cloud resource in Azure.
3. Periodically, usage metrics for the containerized service are sent to an Azure AI services resource in Azure in order to calculate billing for the service.

Even when using a container, you must provision an Azure AI services resource in Azure for billing purposes. Client applications send their requests to the containerized service, meaning that potentially sensitive data is not sent to the Azure AI services endpoint in Azure; but the container must be able to connect to the Azure AI services resource in Azure periodically to send usage metrics for billing.

## Azure AI services container images

Each container provides a subset of Azure AI services functionality. For example, not all features of the Azure AI Language service are in a single container. Language detection, translation, and sentiment analysis are each separate container images. However, the setup steps are similar for each container.

### Language containers

For the AI Language service, the core features map to separate images:

|Feature|Image|
|---|---|
|Key Phrase Extraction|mcr.microsoft.com/azure-cognitive-services/textanalytics/keyphrase|
|Language Detection|mcr.microsoft.com/azure-cognitive-services/textanalytics/language|
|Sentiment Analysis|mcr.microsoft.com/azure-cognitive-services/textanalytics/sentiment|
|Named Entity Recognition|mcr.microsoft.com/product/azure-cognitive-services/textanalytics/language/about|
|Text Analytics for health|mcr.microsoft.com/product/azure-cognitive-services/textanalytics/healthcare/about|
|Translator|mcr.microsoft.com/product/azure-cognitive-services/translator/text-translation/about|
|Summarization|mcr.microsoft.com/azure-cognitive-services/textanalytics/summarization|
### Speech containers

|Feature|Image|
|---|---|
|Speech to text|mcr.microsoft.com/product/azure-cognitive-services/speechservices/speech-to-text/about|
|Custom Speech to text|mcr.microsoft.com/product/azure-cognitive-services/speechservices/custom-speech-to-text/about|
|Neural Text to speech|mcr.microsoft.com/product/azure-cognitive-services/speechservices/neural-text-to-speech/about|
|Speech language detection|mcr.microsoft.com/product/azure-cognitive-services/speechservices/language-detection/about|

### Vision containers

|Feature|Image|
|---|---|
|Read OCR|mcr.microsoft.com/product/azure-cognitive-services/vision/read/about|
|Spatial analysis|mcr.microsoft.com/product/azure-cognitive-services/vision/spatial-analysis/about|

You can use the Docker _pull_ command to download container images to work with them directly from your machine. Some of the containers are in a "Gated" public preview state, and you need to explicitly request access to use them. Otherwise the containers are available for anyone to use with their Azure AI services deployment.

For a full list of currently available Azure AI services container images, and specific notes for each one, see [Azure AI services container image tags and release notes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/cognitive-services-container-support#containers-in-azure-ai-services).

## Azure AI services container configuration

When you deploy an Azure AI services container image to a host, you must specify three settings.

|Setting|Description|
|---|---|
|ApiKey|Key from your deployed Azure AI service; used for billing.|
|Billing|Endpoint URI from your deployed Azure AI service; used for billing.|
|Eula|Value of **accept** to state you accept the license for the container.|

## Consuming Azure AI services from a Container

After your Azure AI services container is deployed, applications consume the containerized Azure AI services endpoint rather than the default Azure endpoint. The client application must be configured with the appropriate endpoint for your container, but does not need to provide a subscription key to be authenticated. You can implement your own authentication solution and apply network security restrictions as appropriate for your specific application scenario.

# Use an Azure AI Services Container

Using Azure AI services hosted in Azure enables application developers to focus on the infrastructure for their own code while benefiting from scalable services that are managed by Microsoft. However, in many scenarios, organizations require more control over their service infrastructure and the data that is passed between services.

Many of the Azure AI services APIs can be packaged and deployed in a _container_, enabling organizations to host Azure AI services in their own infrastructure; for example in local Docker servers, Azure Container Instances, or Azure Kubernetes Services clusters. Containerized Azure AI services need to communicate with an Azure-based Azure AI services account to support billing; but application data is not passed to the back-end service, and organizations have greater control over the deployment configuration of their containers, enabling custom solutions for authentication, scalability, and other considerations.

> **Note**: There is an issue currently being investigated that some users hit where containers won't deploy properly, and calls to those containers fail. Updates to this lab will be made as soon as the issue has been resolved.

## Clone the repository in Visual Studio Code

You'll develop your code using Visual Studio Code. The code files for your app have been provided in a GitHub repo.

> **Tip**: If you have already cloned the **mslearn-ai-services** repo, open it in Visual Studio code. Otherwise, follow these steps to clone it to your development environment.

1. Start Visual Studio Code.
    
2. Open the palette (SHIFT+CTRL+P) and run a **Git: Clone** command to clone the `https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/mslearn-ai-services` repository to a local folder (it doesn't matter which folder).
    
3. When the repository has been cloned, open the folder in Visual Studio Code.
    
4. Wait while additional files are installed to support the C# code projects in the repo, if necessary
    
    > **Note**: If you are prompted to add required assets to build and debug, select **Not Now**.
    
5. Expand the `Labfiles/04-use-a-container` folder.
    

Code for both C# and Python has been provided. Expand the folder of your preferred language.

## Provision an Azure AI Services resource

If you don't already have one in your subscription, you'll need to provision an **Azure AI Services** resource.

1. Open the Azure portal at `https://portal.azure.com`, and sign in using the Microsoft account associated with your Azure subscription.
2. In the top search bar, search for _Azure AI services_, select **Azure AI Services**, and create an Azure AI services multi-service account resource with the following settings:
    - **Subscription**: _Your Azure subscription_
    - **Resource group**: _Choose or create a resource group (if you are using a restricted subscription, you may not have permission to create a new resource group - use the one provided)_
    - **Region**: _Choose any available region_
    - **Name**: _Enter a unique name_
    - **Pricing tier**: Standard S0
3. Select the required checkboxes and create the resource.
4. Wait for deployment to complete, and then view the deployment details.
5. When the resource has been deployed, go to it and view its **Keys and Endpoint** page. You will need the endpoint and one of the keys from this page in the next procedure.

## Deploy and run a Text Analytics container

Many commonly used Azure AI services APIs are available in container images. For a full list, check out the [Azure AI services documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-container-support#container-availability-in-azure-cognitive-services). In this exercise, you'll use the container image for the Text Analytics _language detection_ API; but the principles are the same for all of the available images.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Home** page, select the **＋Create a resource** button, search for _container instances_, and create a **Container Instances** resource with the following settings:
    
    - **Basics**:
        
        - **Subscription**: _Your Azure subscription_
        - **Resource group**: _Choose the resource group containing your Azure AI services resource_
        - **Container name**: _Enter a unique name_
        - **Region**: _Choose any available region_
        - **Image source**: Other Registry
        - **Image type**: Public
        - **Image**: `mcr.microsoft.com/azure-cognitive-services/textanalytics/language:latest`
        - **OS type**: Linux
        - **Size**: 1 vcpu, 12 GB memory
    - **Networking**:
        
        - **Networking type**: Public
        - **DNS name label**: _Enter a unique name for the container endpoint_
        - **Ports**: _Change the TCP port from 80 to **5000**_
    - **Advanced**:
        
        - **Restart policy**: On failure
            
        - **Environment variables**:
            
            |Mark as secure|Key|Value|
            |---|---|---|
            |Yes|`ApiKey`|_Either key for your Azure AI services resource_|
            |Yes|`Billing`|_The endpoint URI for your Azure AI services resource_|
            |No|`Eula`|`accept`|
            
        - **Command override**: [ ]
            
    - **Tags**:
        
        - _Don't add any tags_
2. Select **Review + create** then select **Create**. Wait for deployment to complete, and then go to the deployed resource. > **Note** Please note that deploying an Azure AI container to Azure Container Instances typically takes 5-10 minutes (provisioning) before they are ready to use.
    
3. Observe the following properties of your container instance resource on its **Overview** page:
    
    - **Status**: This should be _Running_.
    - **IP Address**: This is the public IP address you can use to access your container instances.
    - **FQDN**: This is the _fully-qualified domain name_ of the container instances resource, you can use this to access the container instances instead of the IP address.
    
    > **Note**: In this exercise, you've deployed the Azure AI services container image for text translation to an Azure Container Instances (ACI) resource. You can use a similar approach to deploy it to a _[Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)_ host on your own computer or network by running the following command (on a single line) to deploy the language detection container to your local Docker instance, replacing _<yourEndpoint>_ and _<yourKey>_ with your endpoint URI and either of the keys for your Azure AI services resource. The command will look for the image on your local machine, and if it doesn't find it there it will pull it from the _mcr.microsoft.com_ image registry and deploy it to your Docker instance. When deployment is complete, the container will start and listen for incoming requests on port 5000.
    
    ```
    docker run --rm -it -p 5000:5000 --memory 12g --cpus 1 mcr.microsoft.com/azure-cognitive-services/textanalytics/language:latest Eula=accept Billing=<yourEndpoint> ApiKey=<yourKey>
    ```
    

## Use the container

1. In your editor, open **rest-test.cmd** and edit the **curl** command it contains (shown below), replacing _<your_ACI_IP_address_or_FQDN>_ with the IP address or FQDN for your container.
    
    ```
    curl -X POST "http://<your_ACI_IP_address_or_FQDN>:5000/text/analytics/v3.0/languages" -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data-ascii "{'documents':[{'id':1,'text':'Hello world.'},{'id':2,'text':'Salut tout le monde.'}]}"
    ```
    
2. Save your changes to the script by pressing **CTRL+S**. Note that you do not need to specify the Azure AI services endpoint or key - the request is processed by the containerized service. The container in turn communicates periodically with the service in Azure to report usage for billing, but does not send request data.
    
3. Enter the following command to run the script:
    
    ```
    ./rest-test.cmd
    ```
    
4. Verify that the command returns a JSON document containing information about the language detected in the two input documents (which should be English and French).
    

## Clean Up

If you've finished experimenting with your container instance, you should delete it.

1. In the Azure portal, open the resource group where you created your resources for this exercise.
2. Select the container instance resource and delete it.

## Clean up resources

If you're not using the Azure resources created in this lab for other training modules, you can delete them to avoid incurring further charges.

1. Open the Azure portal at `https://portal.azure.com`, and in the top search bar, search for the resources you created in this lab.
    
2. On the resource page, select **Delete** and follow the instructions to delete the resource. Alternatively, you can delete the entire resource group to clean up all resources at the same time.
