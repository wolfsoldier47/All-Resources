Type of workloads:
1 - Machine learning - Foundation for an AI system and its the way to teach computer model to make predictions and draw conclusions from data
2 - Computer vision: Capabilities within AI to interpret the world visually through cameras, video and images
3 - Natural language processing: Capabilities within AI for a computer to interpret written or spoken language and respond in kind
4 - Document intelligence: Capabilities within AI to deal with managing, processing and using high volumes of data found in forms and documents
5 - Knowledge mining: Capabilities within AI to extract information from large volumes of often unstructured data to create a searchable knowledge store
6 - Generative AI: Capabilities within AI that create original content in a variety of formats including natural language, image, code, and more

	1. clustering


- Regression: models are trained to predict numeric label values based on training data that includes both features and known labels.Process involves multiple iterations in which you use an appropriate algorithm to train a model
- Binary classification: it uses a single feature to predict whether the label y is 1 or 0.
- Multi class classification: it calculate probability of multiple class labels, enabling a model to predict the most probable class for a given observation
	- One-vs-Rest(OvR) algorithm
	- Multinomial algorithms
- Clustering:observation are grouped into clusters base on similarities in their data values or features. this is supervised because it doesnt make use of previously known label values to train a model.
	- k-means clustering algorithm

Deep Learning
- machine learning that tries to emulate the way the human brain learns. It creates an artifical neural network that simulates electro chemical activity in biological neurons by using mathematical functions
