## Uses of face detection and analysis

There are many applications for face detection, analysis, and recognition. For example,

- Security - facial recognition can be used in building security applications, and increasingly it is used in smart phones operating systems for unlocking devices.
- Social media - facial recognition can be used to automatically tag known friends in photographs.
- Intelligent monitoring - for example, an automobile might include a system that monitors the driver's face to determine if the driver is looking at the road, looking at a mobile device, or shows signs of tiredness.
- Advertising - analyzing faces in an image can help direct advertisements to an appropriate demographic audience.
- Missing persons - using public cameras systems, facial recognition can be used to identify if a missing person is in the image frame.
- Identity validation - useful at ports of entry kiosks where a person holds a special entry permit.


With **Face analysis**, facial features can be used to train machine learning models to return other information, such as facial features such as nose, eyes, eyebrows, lips, and others.

<h3>AZURE service for face recognition </h3>

Microsoft Azure provides multiple Azure AI services that you can use to detect and analyze faces, including:

- **Azure AI Vision**, which offers face detection and some basic face analysis, such as returning the bounding box coordinates around an image.
- **Azure AI Video Indexer**, which you can use to detect and identify faces in a video.
- **Azure AI Face**, which offers pre-built algorithms that can detect, recognize, and analyze faces.


## Face service

The Azure Face service can return the rectangle coordinates for any human faces that are found in an image, as well as a series of attributes related to those face such as:

- **Accessories**: indicates whether the given face has accessories. This attribute returns possible accessories including headwear, glasses, and mask, with confidence score between zero and one for each accessory.
- **Blur**: how blurred the face is, which can be an indication of how likely the face is to be the main focus of the image.
- **Exposure**: such as whether the image is underexposed or over exposed. This applies to the face in the image and not the overall image exposure.
- **Glasses**: whether or not the person is wearing glasses.
- **Head pose**: the face's orientation in a 3D space.
- **Mask**: indicates whether the face is wearing a mask.
- **Noise**: refers to visual noise in the image. If you have taken a photo with a high ISO setting for darker settings, you would notice this noise in the image. The image looks grainy or full of tiny dots that make the image less clear.
- **Occlusion**: determines if there might be objects blocking the face in the image.

1.

How does the Face service indicate the location of faces in images?

A pair of coordinates for each face, indicating the center of the face

Two pairs of coordinates for each face, indicating the location of the eyes

A set of coordinates for each face, defining a rectangular bounding box around the face

Correct: The locations of detected faces are indicated by coordinates for a rectangular bounding box

2.

What is one aspect that might impair facial detection?

Glasses

Extreme angles

Correct: Best results are obtained when the faces are full-frontal or as near as possible to full-frontal

Fast shutter speed

3.

What two actions are required to try out the capabilities of the Face service?

Create an Azure Cognitive Search resource, and open Vision Studio

Create a Face resource, and open Vision Studio

Correct: The Face resource has face detections capabilities, and can be used in Vision Studio to understand its capabilities.

Create a Face resource, and open Azure OpenAI Studio



# Summary


While Azure AI Vision and Azure AI Video Indexer offer face detection features, the Face service and associated APIs provide more capabilities. Which you should choose will ultimately depend on the insights you want to gain from facial detection. If you want to look for data around facial landmarks, the Face resource is the best choice.
